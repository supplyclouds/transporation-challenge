# Transportation challenge

You're asked to build a simple application that records the location of all trams in Helsinki and visualises the routes on a map.

## Requirements

- You should store the location of all trams in a database. You should check for a new location every 20 seconds.
- In the web interface, you should be able to select a tram from a dropdown menu and see the route on a map. The route can be visualised as a line or as dots. Please consider only the last 20 locations when plotting the route on the map.

## What you should be able to demonstrate

- Testable and modularised code
- Confidence in writing applications using PHP and databases

## APIs

You can find the API for trams in Helsinki [from this link](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/services-and-apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/).

## Instructions

- Fork this repo
- Write the code to retrieve the location every 20 seconds
- Build the user interface to plot the route on a map
- Commit your files to Github
